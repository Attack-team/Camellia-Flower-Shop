# Camellia-Flower-Shop

## Summary of Idea
Our concept revolves around a professional flower shop, that features five pages: Home page, Shopping page, Occasions page (offering special occasion bouquets and exclusive offers, such as those tailored for Mother's Day), Complaint Form, and Cart Page. The Cart Page offers a unique feature allowing customers to select multiple flower types, personalize them into a beautiful bouquet, and even add a thoughtful gift message during the checkout process.

## The problem it solves
Our flower shop idea addresses the common challenge of finding a reliable and convenient source for purchasing exquisite flower arrangements for various occasions. By providing a user-friendly online platform, customers can easily browse and select from a wide range of bouquets specifically designed for special events like Mother's Day. Additionally, our shopping cart feature streamlines the process of customizing and ordering multiple flower types as a bouquet, while also allowing customers to add personalized gift messages. This eliminates the hassle of searching for and purchasing flowers from multiple sources, providing a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience.
